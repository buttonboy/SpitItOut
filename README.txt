This app's intent is to record the user making noises that correlate to various
musical instruments, then transcribe those to actual synthesized instrument tracks,
to effortlessly layer them into a instrumental track.

The idea is to lower the barrier-to-entry on music as low as possible.

If you can think it and create a reasonable facsimile with your voice, it can be music.
